; this setting speeds up FiSH a little at the expense of making blow.ini files created by the
; old FiSH script unusable. You should however always use it when making a new blow.ini file.
; If you change/remove this, you have to re-code this ini file in ANSI (at least if your mark_encrypted has any UTF-8 chars)!

; the maximum defined key length for blowfish is 448 bits or 56 bytes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_%28cipher%29#The_algorithm
; However, some other clients and also FiSH10 in older versions did not enforce this limit. To allow longer keys,
; set this option to zero. If you have the chance to, it's better to instead change your key(s) (which is always a
; good idea) and use a new one with 56 bytes max.
