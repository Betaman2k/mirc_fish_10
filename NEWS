
== 2011-11-15 ==
  * Enabled mIRC6-compatibility encrypted ACTION (/me) workaround to actually work (incoming messages).
  * Fixed outgoing encrypted /me ACTIONs. They were missing their last character.
  * Proper support of UTF-8 encoded cryptmarks when using no_legacy=1 mode without $chr() workaround.
  * Updated OpenSSL to 1.0.0e

== 2011-03-15 ==
  * Updated FiSH_encrypt_msg and FiSH_decrypt_msg DLL routines (for use from within .mrc scripts)
    to be fully backwards-compatible again (keys with characters >=0x80 were broken).
  * Added FiSH_DecryptMsg10 and FiSH_EncryptMsg10 DLL routines with the following signature:
	  <decode_utf8|raw_bytes> <key> <base64data>
	  Use these if you need to work with UTF-8 encoded keys, e.g.:
	  //echo -a $dll(%FiSH_DLL,FiSH_EncryptMsg10,raw_bytes üütf§KEY message here blah blah)

== 2011-02-12 ==
  * Fixed another syntax error in fish_10.mrc
  * Updated OpenSSL to 1.0.0d

== 2011-02-05 ===
	* Fixed issue 23, identified by ex0a (outgoing crypt mark did not respect process_outgoing default).
	* Added an error message on startup if blow.ini is not writable.
	* Updated OpenSSL to 1.0.0c

== 2010-09-28 ==
	* Fixed issues with no_legacy = 1, most notably encrypt_topic and other contact specific
	  settings being broken.
	* Fixed topic-not-being-decrypted issue with no_legacy=1. Kudos to _pac.

== 2010-08-01 ==
	* Fixed nasty bug that caused FiSH_encrypt_msg to fail with *messages* that contained spaces
	  and FiSH_WriteKey10 with *keys* that contained spaces.
	* Added support for $chr(N) and $+ in mark_encrypted as suggested in bug #13.

== 2010-06-19 ==
	* Final build with multi-network support. Read about it in README. You can now use different keys for
	  channels of the same name on different networks.
	* Added no_legacy setting to blow.ini. Find out about it in README.BLOWINI.
	* Made regular "Set Key" right click menu entry use ANSI mode, like in old FiSH,
	  and added a new entry "Set Key (UTF-8)" in case someone needs it.
	* Added context menu entry that allows to selectively disable CBC key exchange mode for a contact.
	* Fixed "CBC Mode" display when setting a key.
	* Fixed topic decryption on topic changes.
	* Fixed encrypt_notice setting.
	* Fixed default plain prefix "+p ".
	* Updated OpenSSL libraries to 1.0.0a.

== 2010-06-12 ==
	* Updated test build, fixed issue 14 (no_legacy = 1 was mostly broken).

== 2010-06-03 ==
	* Test build with multi-network support. Complete changelog will follow with the official release.

== 2010-05-20 ==
	* Added Mircryption compatible CBC mode!
	  Use "cbc:KEYHERE" as key to activate. Incoming messages encrypted using the "old"
	  ECB mode still display fine.
	* Added first-ever CBC mode DH1080 key exchange!
	  Two FiSH 10 users doing a DH1080 key exchange will now automatically use the new
	  CBC mode. Key exchanges with old users are completely unimpaired!

== 2010-05-19 ==
	* Fixed issue #7 (DCC downloads stalling at 99%)

== 2010-05-18 ==
	* Fixed issue #6 (Topic support broken for channel names that contain more than one # sign)
	* Re-prepend cut off channel modes in UnrealIRCD's /list.
	* Added FiSH.dll compatible FiSH_encrypt_msg and FiSH_decrypt_msg exports to
	  fish_10.dll, for use from mIRC script, e.g. like this:
	  echo -a $dll(fish_10.dll,FiSH_encrypt_msg,KEYHERE MESSAGEHERE)
	* Added some debug info to the "patch failed" message (which patch failed)
	* Some internal minor changes

== 2010-05-13 ==
	* Initial release
